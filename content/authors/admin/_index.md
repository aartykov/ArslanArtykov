I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at [Ecole des Ponts ParisTech](https://imagine-lab.enpc.fr/) under the esteemed guidance of [Prof. Vincent Lepetit](https://vincentlepetit.github.io/). Prior to this, I earned both my master's and bachelor's degrees from Istanbul Technical University. My research is primarily centered around the exciting fields of articulated object reconstruction and neural implicit models.
