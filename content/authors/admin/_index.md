I am a M.Sc. student at the Aerospace Engineering department of Istanbul Technical University (ITU). I obtained my B.Sc. from the Aeronautical Engineering department of ITU as a salutatorian student. My research interests are 3D computer vision, generative AI, and robotics. Particularly, I am interested in visual/inertial self-localization of robots, 3D scene reconstruction, diffusion models, 3D mapping with NeRF.
