This project aims to investigate the feasibility of replacing the conventional hand-crafted feature      
extractor module in visual-inertial odometry with a deep learning-based feature extractor. Our research  
demonstrates the comparable performance of the proposed method to the traditional one.                   
Specifically, we implemented a hybrid system based on the widely used state-of-the-art visual-           
inertial system, VINS-Mono, by integrating convolutional neural network (CNN)-based features.            
Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method achieves performance on par with              
the conventional approach while offering potential advantages in terms of robustness and adaptability.
